      <h1>The importance of taking a break from sports</h1>

      <p>It is well known that athletes train hard to maintain their performance levels. But what is often overlooked is the importance of taking a break from sports. This is known as “active rest,” and it is crucial to peak performance.</p>

      <p>Active rest is a period of reduced training or complete rest from training. It is important to have an active rest period built into your training schedule. The length of time and intensity of training should be decreased during this period. The purpose of active rest is to allow your body to recover from the previous training period and to prepare for the next one.</p>

      <p>During active rest, the body repairs damaged muscles, replenishes energy stores, and removes metabolic waste products. This is an important time for the body to adapt to the training load and to become stronger.</p>

      <p>Active rest is just as important as the training itself. It should not be viewed as a waste of time, but rather as an integral part of the training process. By properly incorporating active rest into your training, you will be able to train harder and perform at your best.</p>
